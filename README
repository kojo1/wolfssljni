wolfSSL JNI Wrapper and JSSE Provider

This package provides both a Java, JNI-based interface to the native wolfSSL
(wolfSSL) API and a wolfSSL JSSE provider (wolfJSSE). These provide Java
applications with SSL/TLS support up to the current TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.2
standards.

Note 1)
The java.sh script uses a common location for the Java install location.
If your Java install location is different, this could lead to an error
when running java.sh. In this case, you should modify java.sh to match
your environment.

Build options are :
- ant build (only builds the jar necessary for an app to use)
- ant test  (builds the jar and tests then runs the tests, requires JUNIT setup)
- ant examples (builds the jar and example cases)
- ant clean   (cleans all)


wolfSSL JNI Release X.X.X (TBD)

Release X.X.X has bug fixes and new features including:

- Support for custom TrustManager checkClientTrusted(), checkServerTrusted()
- wolfJSSE TrustManager registered as PKIX provider
- Improved support for auto-loading system CA certificates
- Improved Android TrustManager support
- Use AndroidCAStore KeyStore when available on Android
- Support for X509Certificate.getSubjectAlternativeNames()
- Fix for native memory leak in JSSE WolfSSLTrustX509
- Optimization of WolfSSLTrustX509 to hold less memory at idle
- Addition of missing finalize() methods in some JSSE classes
- Casts to uintptr_t instead of intptr_t at native JNI level
- Conversion to use GetByteArrayElements for potential memory use savings
- Consistently use wolfCrypt XMALLOC/XFREE for native memory allocation
- Use javah in build.xml for older ant/Java versions without nativeheaderdir
